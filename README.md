Handy Jobs Hub   
   description: allows users to both post and find small, practical tasks like painting, cleaning or general labor. Posts can be made by those seeking to hire or those looking to be hired. We believe this platform will provide a solution for both uneducated and inexperienced youth, as well as educated and experienced individuals, offering them the opportunity for one-time side hustles and preventing them from idling.
