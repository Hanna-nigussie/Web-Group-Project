# Web-Group-Project
Handy Jobs Hub   
   description: allows users to both post and find small, practical tasks like painting, cleaning or general labor. Posts can be made by those seeking to hire or those looking to be hired. We believe this platform will provide a solution for both uneducated and inexperienced youth, as well as educated and experienced individuals, offering them the opportunity for one-time side hustles and preventing them from idling. 






    *For our project, we have chosen PostgreSQL as our relational database management system and Prisma as our Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool. We made this choice for the following reasons:- 

1, PostgreSQL is widely used, so there is a lot of support and information available for solving problems, which benefits our team.

2,  PostgreSQL is user-friendly whether you're working on our project locally or remotely, ensuring accessibility without the need for complex hosting setups.

3,Prisma's tools make it easy to update our data model as our project grows, and its clear data modeling helps keep track, making it simple to understand and manage the database structure for better project insights.
